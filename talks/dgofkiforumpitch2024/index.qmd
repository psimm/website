The DGOF KI Forum is a group of industry and academic researchers interested in applications of AI in market research. This was a pitch competition for the best new AI applications in market research.

I pitched [AspectWise](http://aspectwise.teamq.de), an AI-powered data pipeline for analysis of product reviews.

The pitch was preceded by a nomination phase in which AspectWise was chosen as one of the top 5 projects. My colleague Oliver Tabino and me were [interviewed](https://www.marktforschung.de/marktforschung/a/es-gibt-natuerliche-zahlreiche-herausforderungen-die-mit-ki-zu-tun-haben/) by Marktforschung.de.

Congratulations to [Inspirient](https://www.inspirient.de/) who won the pitch competition!
