![Presenting a case study](ephmra2024.jpeg)

This presentation at EPHMRA 2024 was about three ways in which AI makes content analysis more efficient in market research:

1. Structuring text, audio and image inputs
2. Aiding aggregation and reporting with Copilots
3. Enabling market researchers to move from an analyst role to a communicator and strategist role

If you wish to receive a copy of the slides (in German), please contact me.

The slide in the background of the image shows an example of one-stop prompting, see my [article](/blog/one-stop-nlp/) on the topic.

I have given versions of this talk at Bristol Myers Squibb and Roche. If you are interested in a similar presentation at your company or event, please contact me.
