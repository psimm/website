[Woche der Marktforschung](https://www.marktforschung.de/succeet/woche-der-marktforschung/) is an annual event by Marktforschung.de and Succeet. This year Oliver Tabino and me presented three case studies of applied AI in market research:

1. Agile use of LLMs for social media monitoring in pharma
2. Scaleable data pipeline for social media monitoringin cosmetics
3. State of the art accuracy in aspect-based sentiment analysis of reviews using a fine-tuned LLM

With [over 200 attendees](https://www.marktforschung.de/marktforschung/a/das-war-die-fuenfte-wdm-in-zahlen/), this webinar was the second most popular event out of 93 events of the WdM.

Please contact me if you would like to get access to a recording of the presentation on Vimeo (in German).
