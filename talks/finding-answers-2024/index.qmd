Lena Kurzmann from Dialego interviewed me on the topic of implementing AI in market research. The interview was part of the Finding Answers Summit. We discussed text analysis, virtual participants, costs and data privacy. The interview also appeared in episode 13 of the Finding Answers Talk podcast.
