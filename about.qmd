Welcome to my website! I'm Paul Simmering, a developer from Germany specializing in machine learning and natural language processing.

On this website, I write about machine learning, data engineering and developer productivity. It's my practice of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public).

### Work

I work as Technical Expert GenAI Platforms & Services at [Landesbank Baden-Württemberg](https://www.lbbw.de), a leading German bank. I'm a developer on the GenAI team, building an enterprise-grade LLM chat application connected to internal data via RAG. In addition, I serve as an internal consultant for GenAI initiatives.

Previously, I worked as Senior Data Scientist at [Q Agentur für Forschung](https://teamq.de), where I led the development of end-to-end data pipelines for market research powered by large language models.

### Technical interests

- Evaluation of language models and larger systems they are part of
- Document understanding and retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
- Data-efficient model fine-tuning
- Public data sources
- Data storytelling

### Other interests

- Reading personal blogs. Check out my [blogroll](/blogroll.qmd) for recommendations.
- Contemporary art, particularly art inspired by geometry, architecture and nature. My favorites are [Kjetil Golid](https://generated.space), [Owen Pomery](https://owenpomery.com/work) and [Reuben Wu](https://reubenwu.com/selected-work/).
- Parks and gardens, especially [Japanese gardens](/japanese_gardens.qmd). I'm lucky to live close to [Blühendes Barock](https://www.blueba.de/en/) in Ludwigsburg.
- Economics. I hold a B.Sc. in Economics from the University of Mannheim and a M.Sc. in Economics from Aalborg University. Professionally, I pivoted to data science but am still interested in public finance, regional development, pricing strategies and the intersection of sociology, psychology and economics.
- Practical philosophy. I keep a list of the [principles](/principles.qmd) that I find most useful for decision making and contentedness.
- [Euro-style board games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurogame), Magic: The Gathering, Poker, Backgammon and other games that involve luck in a single game but are skill-based in the long run. I also like games involving trading and auctions, such as [Power Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Grid), [Figgie](https://www.figgie.com) and [Bohnanza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohnanza).
- Video games. Particular favorites are: Guild Wars, Baldurs Gate 3, Satisfactory, the Hitman series and the Dark Souls series. Playing as a trader in EVE Online as a teenager drew me to economics and programming.
