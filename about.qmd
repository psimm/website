Hi! I'm Paul Simmering, a data scientist from Germany specializing in machine learning and natural language processing. Besides coding, I enjoy writing and speaking about data science. I work as Senior Data Scientist at [Q Agentur für Forschung](https://teamq.de).

My current focus is aspect-based sentiment analysis using LLMs. My team and I are building [AspectWise](/projects/aspectwise/), a data pipeline for review analysis.

Some things I enjoy outside of work:

- [Euro-style games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurogame), Magic: The Gathering, Poker, Backgammon and other games that involve luck in a single game but are skill-based in the long run. I also like games involving trading and auctions, such as [Power Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Grid) and [Figgie](https://www.figgie.com).
- Contemporary art, particularly generative art and art inspired by geometry. My favorites are [Kjetil Golid](https://generated.space), [Owen Pomery](https://owenpomery.com/work) and [Reuben Wu](https://reubenwu.com/projects).
- Parks and gardens, especially [Japanese gardens](/japanese_gardens.qmd). I'm lucky to live close to [Blühendes Barock](https://www.blueba.de/en/) in Ludwigsburg.
- Design and typography. Some examples: [Berkeley Graphics](https://berkeleygraphics.com), [iA](https://ia.net), [Stripe's website](https://stripe.com/en-de).
- Practical philosophy. I keep a list of the [principles](/principles.qmd) that I find most useful for decision making and contentedness.
