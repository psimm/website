Welcome to my website! I'm Paul Simmering, an AI Engineer from Germany.

### Work

I work as Technical Expert GenAI Platforms & Services at [LBBW](https://www.lbbw.de), a leading German bank. I'm a developer on the GenAI team, building an enterprise-grade LLM chat application connected to internal data via RAG. In addition, I serve as an internal consultant for GenAI initiatives.

Between 2018 and mid-2025, I worked as Senior Data Scientist at [Q Agentur für Forschung](https://teamq.de), where I led the development of end-to-end data pipelines for market research powered by large language models. I joined Q after graduating from Aalborg University with an M.Sc. in Economics. During my studies of economics, I discovered my passion for data science and code and decided to pivot to a career in the field. That worked out to be one of the best decisions I've made.

You can see examples of my work in the [projects](/projects.html) section.

### Blog

On my [blog](/blog.html), I write about applied machine learning with a mix of technical articles, strategic insights and personal reflections. It's my practice of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public).

### Technical interests

- **LLM Evals & Monitoring**: The biggest barrier to scaled AI adoption in business is reliablity and evaluation is the key to proving it. Multi-step reasoning, agentic systems and multi-modal flows have made evaluation much harder than it was with classic NLP, but it's more important than ever.
- **Document understanding and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: A huge amount of knowledge is stored in semi-structured documents, such as contracts, reports, emails and more. They need to be converted to a format LLMs understand, such as Markdown or JSON. Finally, an LLM needs access to data that is relevant to a user's query, which is where RAG comes in.
- **Data-efficient model fine-tuning**: Going beyond prompting by fine-tuning a model with your own data is a powerful way to improve model performance and enable accuracy that isn't possible with prompting alone. Techniques like LoRA make it cost-efficient.
- **Data storytelling**: The best data is useless if it's not presented in a way that is understandable and actionable. I'm a big fan of Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic's [Storytelling with Data](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com) and curious about how AI can be used to bring aspects of it into automated report generation.
- **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)**: The internet offers a vast amount of data that could be used to enhance AI and business intelligence systems, such as news articles, social media posts, and more.

### Personal interests

- **Reading personal blogs**. Check out my [blogroll](/blogroll.qmd) for recommendations of lateral thinkers, deep dives and personal reflections. This is the healthier alternative to doomscrolling on social media.
- **Practical philosophy**. I keep a list of the [principles](/principles.qmd) that I find most useful for decision making and contentedness.
- **Economics**. I hold a B.Sc. in Economics from the University of Mannheim and a M.Sc. in Economics from Aalborg University. Professionally, I pivoted to data science but am still interested in public finance, regional development, pricing strategies and the intersection of sociology, psychology and economics.
- **Parks and gardens**, especially [Japanese gardens](/japanese_gardens.qmd). I'm lucky to live close to [Blühendes Barock](https://www.blueba.de/en/) in Ludwigsburg.
- **Board and card games**: [Euro-style board games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurogame), Magic: The Gathering, Poker, Backgammon and other games that involve luck in a single game but are skill-based in the long run. I also like games involving trading and auctions, such as [Power Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Grid), [Figgie](https://www.figgie.com) and [Bohnanza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohnanza).
- **Video games**. Particular favorites are: Guild Wars, Baldurs Gate 3, Satisfactory, the Hitman series and the Dark Souls series. Playing as a trader in EVE Online as a teenager drew me to economics and programming.
