Hi! I'm Paul Simmering, a data scientist from Germany specializing in machine learning and natural language processing. Besides coding, I enjoy writing and speaking about data science. I work as Senior Data Scientist at [Q Agentur f√ºr Forschung](https://teamq.de).

The best way to contact me is via email: [paul.simmering@gmail.com](mailto:paul.simmering@gmail.com).

What other than data science? Here are some things I enjoy:

- Contemporary art, particularly generative art and art inspired by geometry. My favorites are [Kjetil Golid](https://generated.space), [Owen Pomery](https://owenpomery.com/work) and [Reuben Wu](https://reubenwu.com/projects).
- Parks and gardens, especially Japanese gardens.
- Design and typography. Some examples: [Berkeley Graphics](https://berkeleygraphics.com), [iA](https://ia.net), [Stripe's website](https://stripe.com/en-de).
- [Euro-style games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurogame), Magic: The Gathering, Poker, Backgammon and other games that involve luck in a single game but are skill-based in the long run.

This website is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org). The source is available on [Github](https://github.com/psimm/website).
