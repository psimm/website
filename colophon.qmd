## Building the website

This website is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org), a publishing system for technical writing. Posts are written in Markdown and may contain executable code blocks, which are executed as Jupyter notebooks. The result is static HTML. The source is available on [Github](https://github.com/psimm/website).

## Theme

The design of the website is based on the Solana theme. I have done some customizations:

- home page with a greeting and latest articles
- custom dark mode switch
- some custom CSS, e.g. the CV timeline on the about page

The fonts are [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) for text and [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) for code.

## Hosting

The website hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). I use [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com) for analytics without the need for cookies. The website has been online since December 2021.
