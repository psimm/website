I'm a fan of classic blogs. The quality of content is usually higher than on social media and the longer form allows for more depth. In contrast to social media, I never feel like that I'm wasting time when reading good blogs. The open RSS format can be used with many different readers and it's easy to download things to read offline. If you're looking for recommendations, here are the blogs that I read regularly, organized by topic.
