Photos of Japanese gardens I've visited in Japan and Germany. Click on images to enlarge them.

## Ginkaku-ji, Kyoto

Ginkaku-ji's garden was created in the late 15th century and represents the pinnacle of wabi-sabi aesthetics with its famous raked white sand. The walking paths reveal different perspectives of the temple.

## Tenryu-ji, Kyoto

Tenryu-ji's garden, designed by monk Muso Soseki in 1339, is one of Japan's oldest surviving Zen gardens and a UNESCO World Heritage site. It pioneered the use of borrowed scenery, integrating the Arashiyama mountains into the garden's composition.

## Hakusasonso Hashimoto Kansetsu Museum, Kyoto

Created in the 1910s by painter Hashimoto Kansetsu, this villa garden was designed to inspire artistic work. The three-story pagoda and seasonal displays provided a contemplative setting for cultural gatherings. My visit in 2024 was a serene experience and a welcome break from the tourist crowds at other places.

## Koko-en, Himeji

Built in 1992 on former samurai residence foundations, Koko-en consists of nine themed gardens demonstrating different classical styles. It is like walking through a textbook of perfect examples of each style.

## Blühendes Barock, Ludwigsburg

This garden is part of an 18th-century Baroque garden. It has a bonsai exhibition. The garden isn't far from where I live and I enjoy spending time there as a break.
