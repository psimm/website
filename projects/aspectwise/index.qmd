Q Agentur f√ºr Forschung offers a service for automated analysis of customer reviews in any product category in any European language. I'm the inventor and lead developer. We build on our research in aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Since our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18025) on the SemEval benchmark, we have re-thought ABSA from the ground up and developed a labeling scheme and model that allows for fine-grained analysis of customer reviews. See this example:

This model is the core of our pipeline. There are two other steps: review collection and reporting.

Everything's automated in Dagster with data quality checks at every step. Here's the full stack:

| Category | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| Data | Web scraping services accessed via API |
| Data Warehouse | MotherDuck |
| Data Transformation | dbt, polars |
| Orchestrator | Dagster |
| Models | Fine-tuned LLMs + Prompt engineering |
| Experiment Tracking | Weights & Biases |
| Labeling Tool | Custom Shiny for Python app |
| Reporting | Quarto |

The project leverages several machine learning models for ABSA, text classification, translation, and summarization.
