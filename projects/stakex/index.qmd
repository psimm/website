StakeX is a network analysis approach  for public relations projects. It is in use at Q Insight Agency with clients in public transportation and the energy sector. The approach consists of:

- methods for gathering public data on relevant stakeholders
- building a network based on sociological theory
- analyzing the network through use of force-based layout algorithms and centrality statistics
- extracting valuable insights for customers

To learn more about the method, see the [slides of the talk](/talk/comes2020/) by Thomas Perry and me or check the methods section of the [demo app](https://teamqapp.de/shiny/stakex_operativ/).

I led the development of two Shiny apps for this project. The first is a CRUD app that facilitates data entry into a PostgreSQL database and ensures data integrity. The second is a platform for interactive data analysis featuring graphs with [visNetwork](https://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/) and maps with [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/). Both are hosted on EC2 instances on AWS.

Tech stack: R, PostgreSQL, AWS EC2
