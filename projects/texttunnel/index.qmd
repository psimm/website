texttunnel is a Python package for efficient interaction with the OpenAI API. I developed it in collaboration with Paavo Huoviala at Q Insight Agency.

The package is MIT-licensed and available on [Github](https://github.com/qagentur/texttunnel) and [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/texttunnel/).

An introduction with a business use case is available on the [Q Insight Agency blog](https://teamq.de/blog/144/texttunnel).
