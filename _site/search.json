    "section": "",
    "text": "My master thesis investigates the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in managerial decision making. The thesis was supervised by Assoc. Prof. Daniel S. Hain and Assoc. Prof. Roman Jurowetzki at Aalborg University.\nI also gave a talk about it at a Research Plus conference in Cologne. You can find the slides here.\nCurrent AI is narrow, specialized for single tasks and cannot be applied to others. However, recent developments in general game-playing algorithms suggest that AI will become more generally applicable. In managerial decision making, it could be used as a decision support systems or as an autonomous decision maker. This idea of an artificial business decision maker is studied along four research questions.\n\nHow do AI and human thought processes differ?\nDo AIs and humans make qualitatively different business decisions?\nWhat are the dynamics of competition and cooperation between humans and AI?\nAre there potential problems in value alignment between a business and its AI?\n\n\nThe study approaches these questions by example of a business game. You can play the game online here. The code for the game is available on Github.\nThe game depicts competition between two firms in a consumer goods market and emphasizes innovation and imitation strategies in product development, as well as vertical and horizontal product differentiation. It is played by an AI and human participants. The agent combines Monte Carlo Tree Search with prediction of outcomes using an artificial neural network. Six human participants played two games each against that agent. While playing, they gave a think-aloud protocol. The research questions are answered by combining insights from a content analysis of the protocols and an analysis of the AI’s architecture and processes.\nThe AI combines forward reasoning using tree search and evaluation of situations with artificial neural networks. This parallels humans’ thought processes that combine conscious, effortful thinking with unconscious, effortless evaluation. The differences lie in AI’s superior computational abilities, humans’ superior ability to learn from small samples and humans’ conscious and unconscious social behavior and emotions. The absence of this social behavior causes AI to act qualitatively differently – to consider actions that humans do not. This divergence can take the form of breaches of norms of reciprocity and unorthodox pursuit of a utility function. Instructing an AI is difficult, because humans have utility functions with many inputs that have complex relationships among each other, and may be unaware of elements until they come to bear. Value alignment is an on- going challenge for businesses and policy makers. Further, firms have to learn how to best incorporate AI in their decision making. This includes training employees in the use of AI assistants, developing transparent algorithms and developing an awareness for situations in which the use of AI is inappropriate for technical, legal or social reasons."

    "text": "Results\nGiven 10 examples, GPT-4 outperforms BERT-based models trained on the full dataset, but does not reach the state of the art performance achieved by trained T5 models. The choice of prompt is crucial for performance and adding more examples improves performance further, however driving up the number of input tokens and therefore cost in the process. We discuss solutions such as bundling multiple prediction tasks into one prompt. GPT-4‘s errors are typically related to the idiosyncrasies of the benchmark dataset and extensive labeling rules. It struggles to pick up on the nuances of labeling rules, instead occasionally delivering more commonsense labels. While such errors hamper benchmark performance, they should not necessarily discourage from using LLMs in real-world applications of ABSA or similar tasks."

    "text": "Example tasks\nAs a data scientist on a small team, I wear many hats, from machine learning engineer to cloud architect. Consequently, I often have to work with languages, libraries and tools that I don’t have much experience with.\nHere are 5 tasks I worked on in the last few weeks and my evaluation of how much AI tools have helped me.\n\n1. Writing a Python script to evaluate a model\nThe first task was to write a Python script to evaluate Azure’s PII redaction API on a dataset of social media posts containing PII. The task mainly involved writing pandas code to load data and calculate metrics. Copilot was helpful in speeding up the process by suggesting entire sections of code that I could use without modifications.\nUsefulness: 5/5\n\n\n\nPandas\n\n\n\n\n2. Defining AWS infrastructure using Terraform\nNext, a colleague and I set up a database migration using AWS Database Migration Service (DMS), set up via Terraform. I asked GPT-4 to generate the configuration, and then I asked it more detailed questions, such as how to convert data types. However, the model frequently hallucinated: it made up options that don’t actually exist in AWS DMS. Overall, it was more confusing than helpful.\nUsefulness: 1/5\n\n\n3. Creating, testing and documenting models in dbt\nI created, tested, and documented models in dbt. Copilot made writing SQL for the models faster and was especially good at speeding up my workflow of documenting those models in the schema.yml files. However, since it didn’t know the database schema, it hallucinated tables and columns that don’t exist. GPT-4 was useful for thinking through the deployment of dbt-core on AWS ECS, especially the use of environment variables and the project.yml config file.\nUsefulness: 3/5\n\n\n4. Adjusting a web scraper in JavaScript\nFor the next task, I heavily relied on GPT-4. I had to adjust a web scraper to cover a different path of the target website. The scraper is written in JavaScript, which I’m not familiar with. Here, the “explain step-by-step” shortcut was helpful. GPT-4 was like an expert JS dev patiently explaining the code line by line. However, GPT-4 couldn’t see the target website and didn’t have access to the website’s html. Copying it over was tedious. I found it easier to use the SelectorGadget Chrome extension to find relevant CSS selectors.\nUsefulness: 4/5\n\n\n5. Choosing a dashboard tool\nA new project required building a dashboard, and it was my task to evaluate tools based on features, usability, and price. I tested many GUI-based tools (Metabase, Superset, Tableau, PowerBI and others). GPT-4 could list relevant decision criteria but couldn’t make the decision for me. It wasn’t useful as an information source because of the knowledge cutoff in 2021.\n\n\n\nDashboard"

    "text": "10 Takeaways\n\nCopilot and GPT-4 are at their best helping to write code in commonly used libraries like pandas.\nAs text-based models, Copilot and GPT-4 provide better help for code (text) based apps than GUIs.\nAI assistants are at their best in small projects with a low number of files, ideally just one notebook.\nThey are ideal for working on simple tasks in languages that you’re not familiar with.\nThe models don’t have the context of your project, company, and client, which are critical for more strategic decisions.\nThere’s no good tooling for showing GPT-4 data frames or tables in SQL. This limitation means it can’t contribute to the interpretation.\nThe 2021 training data cutoff for GPT-4 diminishes its usefulness for information retrieval.\nRubber duck debugging is an effective technique for overcoming blocks. Now we have v2 with a duck that can reply. Chatting with GPT-4 about programming challenges helped me.\nLLMs are best for delegating details, so you can focus on the bigger picture. Knowing what and how to ask is critical and being aware of typical sources of hallucinations.\nGPT-4 currently can’t run a non-trivial data science project by itself. It’s more independent than Copilot but not good enough to be an autopilot."

Manipulating data frames is one of the most common data science activities, so choosing the right library for it is key.\nMichael Chow, developer of siuba, a Python port of dplyr on top of pandas wrote describes the situation well:\nThe higher-level libraries he mentions come with a problem : There’s no universal standard.\nIn a discussion of the polars library on Hacker News the user “civilized” put the dplyr user perspective more bluntly:\nI’m more willing to compromise though, so here’s a comparison of the strongest contenders."

For instance, dplyr is more mature than its star count suggests. Comparing the completeness of the documentation and tutorials for dplyr and polars reveals that it’s a day and night difference.\nWith the quantitative comparison out of the way, here’s a qualitative comparison of the Python packages. I’m speaking of my personal opinion of these packages - not a general comparison. My reference is my current use of dplyr in R. When I need more performance, I use tidytable to get most of the speed of data.table with the grammar of dplyr and eager evaluation. Another alternative is dtplyr, which translates dplyr to data.table with lazy evaluation. I also use dbplyr, which translates dplyr to SQL.\nI’ll compare the libraries by running a data transformation pipeline involving import from CSV, mutate, filter, sort, join, group by and summarize. I’ll use the nycflights13 dataset, which is featured in Hadley Wickham’s R for Data Science."

That has a lower memory footprint, but can’t be run repeatedly for the same result, such as in interactive use in a notebook.\nHere, the query() function is slightly awkward with the long string argument. The groupby doesn’t allow renaming on the fly like dplyr, though I don’t consider that a real drawback. Perhaps it’s clearer to rename explicitly anyway.\nPandas has the widest API, offering hundreds of functions for every conceivable manipulation. The clip function used here is one such example. One difference to dplyr is that pandas uses its own methods .mean(), rather than using external ones such as base::mean(). That means using custom functions instead carries a performance penalty.\nAs we’ll see later, pandas is the backend for siuba and ibis, which boil down to pandas code.\nOne difference to all other discussed solutions is that pandas uses a row index. Base R also has this with row names, but the tidyverse and tibbles have largely removed them from common use. I never missed row names. At the times I had to work with them in pandas they were more confusing than helpful. The documentation of polars puts it more bluntly:\n\nNo index. They are not needed. Not having them makes things easier. Convince me otherwise\n\nThat’s quite passive aggressive, but I do agree and wish pandas didn’t have it."

The SQL code is portable to R, C, C++, Java and other programming languages the duckdb has APIs. It’s also portable when the logic is taken to a DB like Postgres, or Clickhouse, or is ported to an ETL framework like DBT.\nThis stands in contrast to polars and pandas code, which has to be rewritten from scratch. It also means that the skill gained in manipulating SQL translates well to other situations. SQL has been around for more than 50 years - learning SQL is future-proofing a career.\nWhile these are big plusses, duckdb isn’t so convenient for interactive data exploration. SQL isn’t as composeable. Composing SQL queries requires many common table expressions (CTEs, WITH x AS (SELECT ...)). Reusing them for other queries is not as easy as with Python. SQL is typically less expressive than Python. It lacks shorthands and it’s awkward when there are many columns. It’s also harder to write custom functions in SQL than in R or Python. This is the motivation for using libraries like pandas and dplyr. But SQL can actually do a surprising amount of things, as database expert Haki Benita explained in a detailed article.\nOr in short, from the documentation of ibis:\n\nSQL is widely used and very convenient when writing simple queries. But as the complexity of operations grow, SQL can become very difficult to deal with.\n\nThen, there’s the issue of how to actually write the SQL code. Writing strings rather than actual Python is awkward and many editors don’t provide syntax highlighting within the strings (Jetbrains editors like PyCharm and DataSpell do). The other option is writing .sql that have placeholders for parameters. That’s cleaner and allows using a linter, but is inconvenient for interactive use.\nSQL is inherently lazily executed, because the query planner needs to take the whole query into account before starting computation. This enables performance gains. For interactive use, lazy evaluation is less convenient, because one can’t see the intermediate results at each step. Speed of iteration is critical: the faster one can iterate, the more hypotheses about the data can be tested.\nThere is a programmatic way to construct queries for duckdb, designed to provide a dbplyr alternative in Python. Unfortunately its documentation is sparse.\nUsing duckdb without pandas doesn’t seem feasible for exploratory data analysis, because graphing packages like seaborn and plotly expect a pandas data frame or similar as an input."

    "text": "ibis: Lingua franca in Python\nThe goal of ibis is to provide a universal language for working with data frames in Python, regardless of the backend that is used. It’s tagline is: Write your analytics code once, run in everywhere. This is similar to how dplyr can use SQL as a backend with dbplyr and data.table with dtplyr.\nAmong others, Ibis supports pandas, PostgreSQL and SQLite as backends. Unfortunately duckdb is not an available backend, because the authors of duckdb have decided against building on ibis.\nThe ibis project aims to bridge the gap between the needs of interactive data analysis and the capabilities of SQL, which I have detailed in the previous section on duckdb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nUPDATE October 2023\n\nDuckdb is now a supported backend (along with many more). So performance is going to be very similar to duckdb.\nDirectly load/save data\njoin(), clip(), and case() are well-supported\nIbis is much more popular and now very actively maintained. There are more examples, better documentation, and community. Still definitely less than pandas, but perhaps comparable to polars.\n\nThanks to NickCrews for providing this update, including the following code example.\n\n\nFor the test drive, I’ll use the duckdb backend, meaning that the ibis code is translated to duckdb operations, similar to how siuba is translated to pandas.

    "text": "Conclusion\nIt’s not a clear-cut choice. None of the options offer a syntax that is as convenient for interactive analysis as dplyr. siuba is the closest to it, but dplyr still has an edge with tidy evaluation, letting users refer to columns in a data frame by their names (colname) directly, without any wrappers. But I’ve also seen it be confusing for newbies to R that mix it up with base R’s syntax. It’s also harder to program with, where it’s necessary to use operators like {{ }} and :=.\nMy appreciation for dplyr (and the closely associated tidyr) grew during this research. Not only is it a widely accepted standard like pandas, it can also be used as a translation layer for backends like SQL databases (including duckdb), data.table, and Spark. All while having the most elegant and flexible syntax available.\nPersonally, I’ll primarily leverage SQL and a OLAP database (such as Clickhouse or Snowflake) running on a server to do the heavy lifting. For steps that are better done locally, I’ll use pandas for maximum compatibility. I find the use of an index inconvenient, but there’s so much online help available on StackOverflow. Github Copilot also deserves a mention for making it easier to pick up. Other use cases can be very different, so I don’t mean to say that my way is the best. For instance, if the data is not already on a server, fast local processing with polars may be best.\nMost data science work happens in a team. Choosing a library that all team members are familiar with is critical for collaboration. That is typically SQL, pandas or dplyr. The performance gains from using a less common library like polars have to be weighed against the effort spent learning the syntax as well as the increased likelihood of bugs, when beginners write in a new syntax.\nRelated articles:\n\nPolars: the fastest DataFrame library you’ve never heard of\nWhat would it take to recreate dplyr in python?\nPandas has a hard job (and does it well)\ndplyr in Python?

    "text": "Discontinued yarns\nThe column boolean column “discontinued” indicates whether a manufacturer has stopped producing a yarn. This sparked a question: are unpopular yarns more likely to be discontinued?\nLet’s see a boxplot of the rating average for discontinued and non-discontinued yarns. I visualize the data with plotly express. It can’t handle polars DataFrames, so I convert it to a pandas DataFrame first, using the pl.DataFrame.to_pandas() method.\n\ndiscontinued_df = yarn.select(\n    [\n        \"discontinued\",\n        \"rating_average\",\n    ]\n).drop_nulls()\n\nimport plotly.express as px\n\nfig = px.box(\n    data_frame=discontinued_df.to_pandas(),\n    x=\"discontinued\",\n    y=\"rating_average\",\n    title=\"Rating Average by Discontinued\",\n    color=\"discontinued\",\n)\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe boxplot shows that discontinued yarns (True, in red) indeed have a lower rating than non-discontinued yarns. But is this difference statistically significant? I can use a t-test to find out. scipy.stats has a function for this. I’m choosing a two sample t-test, because I’m comparing two groups and I’m using a two-sided test because I don’t want to rule out that the discontinued yarns have a higher rating than the non-discontinued yarns.\nHere, I use the pl.Series.to_numpy() method to convert the polars Series to a numpy array.\n\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n\nttest_ind(\n    a=discontinued_df.filter(pl.col(\"discontinued\") == True)\n    .select(\"rating_average\")\n    .to_numpy(),\n    b=discontinued_df.filter(pl.col(\"discontinued\") == False)\n    .select(\"rating_average\")\n    .to_numpy(),\n)\n\nTtestResult(statistic=array([-79.57208971]), pvalue=array([0.]), df=array([89384.]))\n\n\nSo yes, the result is statistically significant. The p-value is very small, so we can reject the null hypothesis that the two groups have the same rating average."

According to my girlfriend, it’s particularly popular in Scandinavia.\nThe yardage, weight and thickness of yarn is expressed with multiple metrics. Let’s see the correlation between them to better understand their meanings. Polars doesn’t have a built-in function to get the correlation between all columns. The pl.pearson_corr() function can be used to calculate the correlation between two columns. I convert it to a pandas DataFrame to use its corr() method.\n\ncorr = (\n    yarn.select(\n        [\n            \"yardage\",\n            \"grams\",\n            \"machine_washable\",\n            \"max_gauge\",\n            \"min_gauge\",\n            \"yarn_weight_ply\",\n            \"yarn_weight_knit_gauge\",\n            \"yarn_weight_wpi\",\n        ]\n    )\n    .drop_nulls()\n    .to_pandas()\n    .corr()\n)\n\n# Visualize as a heatmap using plotly\n\nimport plotly.io as pio\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\npio.templates.default = \"plotly_white\"\n\n# Only show the upper triangle of the correlation matrix\n# Set the diagonal and lower triangle to NaN\nimport numpy as np\n\nmask = np.triu(np.ones_like(corr, dtype=bool))\n\nfig = go.Figure()\nfig.add_trace(\n    go.Heatmap(\n        z=corr.mask(mask),\n        x=corr.columns,\n        y=corr.columns,\n        colorscale=px.colors.diverging.RdBu,\n        zmin=-1,\n        zmax=1,\n    )\n)\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe correlation matrix shows some facts about yarns:\n\nLong yarns (high yardage) makes the yarn ball heavier (high grams)\nHigh ply yarns are typically sold in shorter yardage\nHigh ply yarns are less commonly mashine washable\nThe maximum and minimum gauge are in a small range of one another, depending on the yarn weight\nA thick yarn (high ply, high WPI (wraps per inch)) means fewer stitches fit into the gauge\n\nAnd that’s it!

Therefore, it would be better to hold the MSCI World than picking random individual stocks as it is at the efficient frontier."

This also stabilized the MSCI World, which had a dip but recovered within months.\nWill FANGMANT continue to outperform the MSCI World? Hundreds of thousands of analysts are trying to figure it out. According to the efficient market hypothesis, all information is already priced in, including expected future developments (new inventions, products, management practices, consumption cycles). An investor without inside information can’t predict the future price. But the theory isn’t without criticism.\nPhoto by Maxim Hopman on Unsplash"

There is also a giant library of examples, all with source code\nIt’s free to use commercially, unlike Highcharts, which otherwise ticks the same boxes\nIn the development version, echarts4r offers proxies for interaction with Shiny (see https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/articles/shiny.html)\n\nIn addition to these advantages, it also offers features not seen in other packages (or at least not in this specific form): Geospatial 3D maps and timelines\nIn terms of ease of use, I’d put echarts4r in the middle of the pack. The R documentation is easy to follow and has good examples, but it cannot cover every detail, so one has to consult the official echarts documentation frequently. However, in contrast with learning D3 from scratch, this doesn’t take much time, an advantage that GitLab also noted in their comparison. As a long time ggplot2 user, I do miss the in-depth aesthetic mappings of ggplot2, faceting and ease of use when customizing axes. One last thing to keep in mind is that as a recent package and a larger userbase in China than in the West, StackOverflow doesn’t yet have many questions and answers on echarts."

They’re likely to pay off for a whole career.\n\nDescriptive statistics and probability distributions: Understanding variance, quantiles, conditional probability and hypothesis tests is essential. These building blocks of statistics won’t change.\nLinear regression and its variants: These can answer many questions by themselves and also serve as a benchmark for more sophisticated machine learning algorithms. Understanding variants like logistic regression and regularized least squares widens the range of questions you can answer and deepens your understanding of machine learning.\nData visualization principles: A visual expression of data makes the information more accessible. Knowing which visualization is suitable for different types of data and questions makes you a more competent communicator and multiplies the impact your analyses have. Note that I’m only referring to the principles as long-term skills. The plotting libraries come and go.\nEffective writing: Whether it’s writing a report, a proposal, a support ticket or an email: Writing with clarity boosts anyone’s effectiveness.\nSQL: This is the only language on the list. SQL is ubiquitous and has been in use for almost 50 years. Being able to access data at the source is essential for anyone working in the data industry. The SQL standard changes very slowly. Different databases implement variants of the language, but the core commands work everywhere.\nGit: Using version control is non-negotiable when working in a team and Git is the unanimous leading choice.\nText editor mastery: Using a text editor or IDE efficiently by touch typing and keyboard shortcuts removes a barrier. Speed isn’t the point, it’s freeing your mind from needing to expend energy on typing. To safeguard your skill investment, use a free editor that supports many programming languages, for example Visual Studio Code.\n\nIf you don’t know what to start with, practice a golden long-term skill."

R and Python are the two top choices for programming data analysis. You can also program it with Julia, Java and many other languages, but R and Python have the most package libraries and widest support.\nA charting library: Creating visualizations with code makes them reuseable, reproducible and with some practice also quicker to make. There are endless charting libraries. Some popular examples are: ggplot2, matplotlib, seaborn, echarts.\nA machine learning framework: Examples are: scikit-learn, tidymodels, caret, mlr3. When using neural networks, one of Pytorch or Tensorflow is typically required.\nA data quality testing library: Examples are: pointblank, Great Expectations. You could also use constraints in a SQL database.\nA package manager: Examples are: renv, pip, poetry, conda.\nAn orchestration platform: Examples are Airflow, Dagster, drake, dbt. Data scientists often don’t have to set these up and maintain them themselves, but need to know how to submit and monitor jobs running on them.\n\nThese can end up as gig skills. Throughout your career, you’ll likely have to switch between them, either because a new library outshines the older ones or because you join a team that uses a different one. Each switch incurs a cost of relearning. Thankfully, the different implementations often share principles. Learning your third visualization library will be much faster than the first.

The developer account is free and you can create one here: https://developer.twitter.com/en.\nOnce you have the API keys, save them as environment variables. This is much safer than placing them directly into the code.\nHere’s a function that uses the twitter package to fetch tweets that mention a keyword:\nimport twitter\nimport os\n\ndef get_tweets(term: str, count: int, since_id: str = None) -&gt; list[dict]:\n    # Authenticate with Twitter API\n    api = twitter.Api(\n        consumer_key=os.environ[\"TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY\"],\n        consumer_secret=os.environ[\"TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET\"],\n        access_token_key=os.environ[\"TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN\"],\n        access_token_secret=os.environ[\"TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET\"],\n    )\n\n    # Fetch tweets that mention the term\n    tweets=api.GetSearch(\n        term=term,\n        count=count,\n        since_id=since_id,\n        lang=\"en\", # adjust to fetch tweets in other languages\n        result_type=\"recent\",\n    )\n\n    # Turn tweets object into a list of dictionaries\n    tweets_dict_list = [t.AsDict() for t in tweets]\n    return tweets_dict_list\nTo optimally use Twitter’s API limits, we want to only fetch tweets that we don’t have yet. That is done using the since_id parameter. The since_id is the id of the last tweet that we fetched. We can save this id to a file, and use it as the since_id parameter in the next call to get_tweets().\nIn addition to short term limits, the Twitter API caps data collection to 500k Tweets per month with Essential access and 2m Tweets per month with Elevated access."

From there, it could be analyzed using a data lake engine like AWS Athena, or loaded into a data warehouse.\nHere’s a function to save the tweets from a call to get_tweets() to an S3 bucket:\nimport boto3\nimport json\n\ndef save_tweets(filename: str, tweets: list[dict]):\n    # Save JSON to S3\n    s3 = boto3.client(\"s3\") # requires AWS credentials\n    s3.put_object(\n        Bucket=os.environ[\"S3_BUCKET\"],\n        Key=filename,\n        Body=json.dumps(tweets),\n    )\n\n    print(f\"Saved {len(tweets)} tweets to {filename} on S3\")\nOf course you could also substitute any other blob storage, such as Azure Blob Storage or Google Cloud Storage.\n\nS3 storage costs\nOver time, the S3 bucket will fill with JSON files. Each file will contain a list of tweets that mention a keyword. A JSON file containing 100 tweets is about 300 kB. If we assume that we fetch 100 tweets every 15 minutes for a keyword, we’ll have about 29 mB of data per day. That’s about 1 GB per month, per keyword. Zipping the files will reduce the size by about 85%, but it will make them a bit harder to work with.\nThe AWS free tier offers 5 GB of storage per month. After that, you’ll need to pay for the storage. In addition, there will be a charge for the number of PUT requests to S3. Each keyword will generate about 3,000 PUT requests per month, which amounts to $0.015 per month. The free tier allows 2,000 PUT requests per month."

    "text": "Automating in the cloud using Modal\nModal is a Python framework for automating the deployment and scheduling of Python functions. It’s designed to be simple and easy to use. I found it easier and more powerful than AWS Lambda. They offer a $30 monthly free tier.\nModal takes Python code that is decorated with @stub.function() and deploys it to the cloud. It also handles the scheduling of the functions. The code is run in a Docker container, so you can use any Python package you want. Modal also provides a distributed dictionary, called stub.info in the code below that can be used to global variables. This is useful for storing the S3 bucket name, for example.\nimport modal\n\nstub = modal.Stub(\n    image=modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install([\"boto3\", \"python-twitter\"])\n)\nHere we instruct Modal to build a Docker image that contains the boto3 and python-twitter packages. This image will be used to run the code in the cloud.\n\nScheduling\nThe Twitter API imposes a rate limit that resets every 15 minutes. So we’ll wrap the loop we previously wrote into a main() function to run every 15 minutes. This is done using the schedule argument in the @stub.function() decorator.\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n@stub.function(schedule=modal.Period(minutes=15))\ndef main():\n    terms = get_terms.call()\n\n    print(f\"Terms to search: {', '.join([t['term'] for t in terms])}\")\n\n    for term in terms:\n        print(f\"Searching for term: {term['term']}\")\n\n        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H-%M-%S\")\n        filename = f\"{timestamp} {term['term']}.json\".replace(\" \", \"_\")\n\n        try:\n            tweets = get_tweets.call(term[\"term\"], 100)  # maximum allowed\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(e)\n            print(\"Could not get tweets. Saving tweets collected so far.\")\n            break\n\n        since_id = save_tweets.call(filename, tweets)  # returns since_id\n\n        # Update values in terms\n        term[\"since_id\"] = since_id\n        term[\"timestamp_last_search\"] = timestamp\n\n    save_terms.call(terms)\nNote that I’ve used the call() method to call the functions that we defined earlier. This is because we want them to run as Modal stubs in the cloud. The previous functions need slight modifications to become stubs. For example, the get_tweets function needs to be decorated like so:\n@stub.function(secret=modal.Secret.from_name(\"twitter-api\"))\ndef get_tweets()\n    ...\nThis lets Modal recognize it as a runnable function and also tells it to supply a secret variable to it. I’ve defined the secret variable in the Modal dashboard. The twitter-api secret variable contains the Twitter API keys and tokens. The aws-s3-access secret variable contains the AWS access key and secret key for an IAM user that has access to the S3 bucket.\n\n\nRunning and deploying\nTo run the app on Modal, we need to wrap the main() function in a if __name__ == \"__main__\" block. This lets us run the function from the command line. We also need to call stub.run() to start the stubs.\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    with stub.run():\n        main()\nTo run this, use python app.py. The execution will happen on Modal. You can see the logs in the Modal dashboard. To schedule it, run modal deploy app.py. Modal automatically logs the runs and informs you if there are any errors.\n\n\nModal monitoring & costs\nModal charges CPU and memory by the second and only charges for what’s actually used. See their pricing. Cron jobs, monitoring, logging and custom Docker images are free.\n\n\n\nMonitoring\n\n\nThe monitoring dashboard shows the scheduled executions, the CPU and memory usage, and the logs. As shown in the screenshot, I encountered a few errors while testing the app. The logs helped me debug the issues. The app never used even 0.05 CPU cores at a time and requires less than 10 MB of memory. Thanks to Modal’s pricing model, this app will cost less than $1 per month to run.\nIn addition to monitoring via Modal, you may wish to sign to updates from the Twitter API status page. This will inform you of any issues with the API."

I’ll write about that in a future post.\nIf you wish to run this app yourself, you can clone the repo from GitHub and follow the install instructions in the README.\nPhoto by Joshua Sortino on Unsplash"

Besides coding, I enjoy writing and speaking about data science.\nI’m the inventor and lead developer of Cosmention, an AI-powered social media monitoring tool for cosmetics. It’s a fully automated data pipeline for collecting social media posts, analyzing them with ML and reporting via dashboard and email. It’s in use at Europe’s largest drugstore chain dm Drogerie Markt.\nThe best way to contact me is via email: paul.simmering@gmail.com.\nWhat other than data science? Here are some things I enjoy:\n\nDesign and typography. Some examples: Berkeley Graphics, iA, Stripe’s website.\nContemporary art, particularly generative art and art inspired by geometry. My favorites are Kjetil Golid, Owen Pomery and Reuben Wu.\nParks and gardens, especially Japanese gardens.\nEuro-style games, Magic: The Gathering, Poker, Backgammon and other games that involve luck in a single game but are skill-based in the long run.\n\nThis website is built with Quarto.

These are mainly technical data (e.g. internet browser, operating system or time of webpage view). The collection of these data occurs automatically as soon as you enter this website.\n\n\n\nSome of the data is collected to ensure that the website is error-free. Other data may be used to analyze your user behavior.\n\n\n\nYou have the right to receive information about the origin, recipient and purpose of your stored personal data free of charge at any time. You also have the right to request the correction, blocking or deletion of this data.

If appropriate consent was requested, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 Para. 1 TTDSG, insofar as the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information on the user’s terminal device (e.g., device fingerprinting) in the sense of the TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time.\nOur host(s) will only process your data to the extent necessary to fulfil its performance obligations and will comply with our instructions regarding this data.\nWe use the following host(s):\nNetlify 44 Montgomery Street, Suite 300, San Francisco, California 94104, USA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe operators of this website take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.\nWhen you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data refers to data that can be used to identify you personally. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.\nWe would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.\n\n\n\nThe responsible body for data processing on this website is:\nPaul Simmering\nJägerhofallee 30\n71638 Ludwigsburg\nE-Mail: paul.simmering@gmail.com\nThe responsible body is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).\n\n\n\nUnless a more specific storage period has been specified within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for the data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, the data will be deleted after these reasons no longer apply.\n\n\n\nIf you have given consent to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a GDPR, if special categories of data according to Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR are processed. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing also takes place on the basis of Art. 49 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to access information on your terminal device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing also takes place based on § 25 Para. 1 TTDSG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data are necessary for contract fulfillment or for performing pre-contractual measures, we process your data based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if they are necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing may also take place based on our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The relevant legal bases in individual cases are informed about in the following paragraphs of this data protection declaration.\n\n\n\nAs part of our activities, we cooperate with various external parties. Sometimes a transfer of personal data to these external parties is also necessary. We only transfer personal data to external parties if this is necessary for contract fulfillment, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the transfer pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR or if another legal basis allows data transfer. When using contract processors, we only pass on customers’ personal data based on a valid contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint processing is concluded.\n\n\n\nMany data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke your consent at any time. The legality of the data processing up to the point of revocation remained unaffected by the revocation.\n\n\n\nIF THE DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. PLEASE REFER TO THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION FOR THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE CAN PROVE COMPELLING REASONS WORTHY OF PROTECTION FOR THE PROCESSING, WHICH OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE, OR DEFEND LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 ABS. 1 DSGVO).\nIF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 ABS. 2 DSGVO).\n\n\n\nIn the event of violations of GDPR, the data subject has a right to complain to a supervisory authority, especially in the member state of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the suspected violation. The right to complain exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.\n\n\n\nYou have the right to have the data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of data to another person responsible, this will only be done if it is technically feasible.\n\n\n\nUnder the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, their origin and recipients, and the purpose of the data processing and, if necessary, a right to correct or delete this data. For this as well as for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.\n\n\n\nYou have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time for this. The right to restrict processing exists in certain cases.\n\nIf you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we generally need time to verify this. For the duration of the examination, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.\nIf the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.\nIf we no longer need your personal data, but you need them to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.\nIf you have filed an objection according to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be made between your and our interests. As long as it is unclear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.\nIf you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data may - apart from their storage - only be processed with your consent or to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of significant public interest of the European Union or a Member State.\n\nSource: https://www.e-recht24.de"
